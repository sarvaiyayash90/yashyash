                <p>ASP.NET has become a commonly used and a most accepted technology for creating robust dynamic & scalable web applications. ASP.NET is a part of Visual Studio .NET Framework; you can easily code ASP.NET applications in most .NET compatible languages including VB.NET, C#, and J#. ASP.NET pages commonly known as Web Forms are compiled and stored on the web server for providing better performance. Web Forms give you the flexibly to build powerful forms-based website pages. While building Web Forms based website pages you can use ASP.NET server controls to create common User Interface (UI) elements and code them for accomplishing common tasks.</p>
                <p>ASP.Net 2.0 / ASP.Net 3.5 / ASP.Net 4.0 are the latest programming framework by Microsoft allows us for rapid, robust, well organized application code, modular & scalable development of powerful web applications. The best part of using ASP.NET application is that you donâ€™t need to put your source code (.VB or .CS) files to the web server because ASP.NET supports Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and it inherit all the coding for the page from an encrypted (.DLL or Dynamic Link Library) file that store on BIN Directory of the root of your web server.</p>

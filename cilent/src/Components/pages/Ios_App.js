                <h4><b>iOS Development Process</b></h4>
                <p><b>Ideation:–</b> Before launching an app, it is important to have a clear focus on what challenges the mobile app solves, who the target audience is, what features it includes, and so on. In addition, it is important to conduct important market research to ensure that the app will be competitive in its market or market niche. The planning phase also includes adjusting all the requirements required in the subsequent phases of the application development process.</p>
                <p><b>Design phase:-</b> At this stage, the design team comes up with a user interface and user experience, i.e. appearance, realization, and navigation. This design has since been taken by mobile app developers.</p>
                <p><b>Stage of development:-</b> This phase of the flow of the application development process involves creating a functional application from an existing design.</p>
                <p><b>Testing Phase:-</b> When development is complete, testing the application is mandatory. QA reviews the application to make sure it works by default and has no errors.</p>
                <p><b>Launch & Maintenance:-</b> Once the application is verified and reviewed by the customer, it can be launched in the market. However, this does not end the application development phase, as each application requires constant maintenance and must be updated frequently to take into account rapidly changing customer demand. Therefore, at this stage, only another development cycle begins.</p>
